### Abstract
I wanted to see statistics of crimes occuring in parks throughout the five boroughs of NYC and compare them to total crime in NYC to see if it was a significant problem or not. I wanted to delve into this information because I personally live near a park that's not at all dangerous during the daytime, but becomes a sketchy place to walk in during the night. I gathered data from official documentation provided by the NYPD of all five boroughs and sorted them using pandas. Results show that across all five boroughs, crime occuring in parks was not a statistically significant portion of overall crime.
